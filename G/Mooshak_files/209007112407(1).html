<h1 align="CENTER">Problem G - At the Supermarket</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The supermarket close to your place is making a special offer: for each different
item that you buy, you receive a bonus amount on your supermarket loyalty card.
You can use this bonus to buy other items in the following weeks.</p><p>

Your plan is to go the supermarket with your uncle's truck and get as much bonus
credit as you can. Of course, you only have a certain amount of money to spend,
and the truck can only carry so much weight.</p><p>
