<h2>Description</h2>

<p>To celebrate the very good financial results of the last year, your boss wants
to award some extra money to all the workers in the company.
He knows that he must reward some workers more than others based
on their positions and roles in the company. For example, a project leader
must get a greater reward than the other participants in that project, and
a manager must get more than his or her secretary.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, he is also <i>really</i> tight with money, so he wants to spend
as little as possible on these incentives. He decides that the incentives will
be payed as cash, and that everybody will get 10€ or, if strictly necessary,
a multiple of that amount. You are asked to find out how many 10€ notes
he will have to get from the bank.
</p><p>
</p><hr>

<h2>Input</h2> 

Each input contains a number of test cases. The number of workers, <i>n</i> &#8804; 10000, and a number
of worker pairs, <i>m</i>, are given in the first line. Then, <i>m</i> lines follow, each
containing two integers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, each between 1 and <i>n</i>, indicating that
worker <i>i</i> must get a greater reward than worker <i>j</i>. More test cases may follow,
starting in the next line.
<hr>

<h2>Output</h2>

For each test case, your programme should print on a separate line the number of
10€ notes that must be withdrawn from the bank in order to pay the
incentives. If the restrictions imposed by your boss are contradictory, the
result should be -1.
