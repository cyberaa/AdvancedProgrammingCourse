<h1 align="CENTER"> Problem F - Timetabler</h1>

<hr>

<h2> Description</h2> Given a number of events with a fixed schedule,
assign rooms to events such that the number of rooms needed is
minimized. No room can be assigned to events that overlap in
time. Assume that the number of rooms available is equal to the number
of events.  In addition, assume that the events and the rooms are
numbered from 1 to n.<p>


 </p><hr> <h2>Input</h2> 

Each test case starts with the number of events (<i>n</i>).  The
next <i>n</i> lines provide information about the events.
The <i>i</i>-th line gives the starting and finishing times (as
integers) of the <i>i</i>-th event.

<hr>

<h2>Output</h2>

The output consists of <i>n+1</i> lines. Each of the first n lines
should give the event number and the room number. There is no
particular requirement for the ordering of the event-room
assignments. In the last line, output the total number of rooms
needed.
