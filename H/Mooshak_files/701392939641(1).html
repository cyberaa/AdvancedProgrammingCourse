<title>Problem H - All trains go to Beijing</title>


<h1 align="CENTER">Problem H - All trains go to Beijing</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
You are spending your holidays in China, and you hear about a general strike in Beijing 
for better working conditions. As you want to see what's going on, you go to the 
closest train station to buy a ticket for the next train to Beijing. 
Unfortunately, the person selling the tickets does not speak a word of English,
and you forgot your dictionary in the hotel. So, you check where Beijing is
on a big electronic map at the train station, but 
you can only understand the train directions between the cities, as all the rest is 
written in Chinese, including the names of the cities.</p><p>

Many people would give up at this point. However, you are though, and decide to
use your brain to find your way to Beijing by train.

<h2>Input</h2> 

The first line indicates the number of cities (<i>n</i>) and number of connections (<it>m</it>) between 
those cities. The cities are numbered from <i>0</i> to <i>n-1</i>. Then, <i>m</i> lines follow. 
Each line contains two non-negative values: the source and the destination. Other test cases may follow.
There are at most 6000 cities and 1900000 connections.

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case, your program should check whether your reasoning above is
correct. If it is, the program should output the number corresponding to the city
of Beijing. Otherwise, it should output "nix".
