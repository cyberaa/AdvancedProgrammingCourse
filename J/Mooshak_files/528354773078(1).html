<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A stickman is a man drawn with sticks, and everybody can draw one. As a
children's game designer, you decide to generalize the idea, and come up
with the concept of a "stickmonster"!
</p><p>
Your stickmonster kit consists of a box with a disk, <i>n</i> bolt-and-nut pairs
numbered from 1 to <i>n</i>, and
<i>n</i>&#8722;1 sticks. Sticks can be bolted to each other at the ends, if one
wishes, or one end may just be left dangling. In that case, it is best to keep a
bolt and nut tighly fastened at the loose end, lest you lose them by accident.
A real stickmonster will use all parts in the box: sticks, bolts and nuts!
The figure above illustrates the idea.
</p><p>
The real fun begins when it comes to deciding to which bolt the head (the disk) should be attached...
</p><p>
</p><hr>

<h2>Input</h2> 

Each test case describes a single stickmonster already assembled. The number of
bolts (and nuts), <i>n</i>, is given in the first line. Then, <i>n&#8722;1</i> lines follow, each
containing the numbers of the screws at the end of each stick (two integers separated by a space).
<hr>

<h2>Output</h2>

Your programme should compute where to attach the head to make the stickmonster
as short as possible and as tall as possible, where the height of the stickmonster
is the maximum number of sticks from head to "toe". It should output the
bolt number(s) in each case, sorted in ascending order.
