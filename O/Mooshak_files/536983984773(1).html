<title>Problem O - Roadside trees</title>


<h1 align="CENTER"> Problem O - Roadside trees</h1>

<hr>

<h2> Description</h2>

After a new road was build, many trees were planted at regular intervals along
the road. Since young trees often die shortly after being planted, they were planted
quite close together. As expected, many trees did die shortly after, but a good
number of them survived.
<p>
As the trees grew bigger and bigger, it became clear that some were too close
together. In addition, cutting some trees down would allow money to be raised by
selling the timber. Therefore, the road department decided to leave standing only
a number of trees, to be selected so that they were as far apart from each other
as possible.

Would you have been able to help them?

<h2>Input</h2> 

There may be several test cases in each input file. The first line of each test case
consists of two integers: the original number of trees, <i>n</i>, and the number of
trees to leave standing, <i>k</i>. Then, <i>n</i> lines follow, each containing the
integer position of a tree along the road, in ascending order. A new test case may
follow in the next line.
<p>
</p><hr>


<h2>Output</h2>

For each test case, print the maximum distance that can be achieved
between the two closest trees among the <i>k</i> trees left standing along the road.
