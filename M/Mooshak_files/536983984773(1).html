<h1 align="CENTER">Problem M - Wabbits!</h1>

<hr>


<h2>Description</h2>

There are <i>m</i> rabbits in a cage. <i>n</i> rabbits are black, and the rest
are white. Someone leaves the door open, and all the rabbits escape, one by one.
What is the probability of at least two black rabbits leaving the cage one after the
other, without white rabbits in between?

<h2>Input</h2> 

The input may consist of several test cases. 
Each line gives the total number of rabbits in the cage, <i>m</i>, and the number of black rabbits, <i>n</i>.
There are at most 42 rabbits in the cage, of which at most 17 are black.<p>

</p><hr>

<h2>Output</h2>

The output for each test case is the probability of at least two black rabbits
leaving the cage one after the other, expressed as a fraction reduced to lowest terms.
For example, if the probability is exactly 0.5, then the output should be 1/2, not
3/6 or 2/4.
