<title>Problem E - Word stretcher</title>


<h1 align="CENTER"> Problem E - Word stretcher</h1>

<hr>

<h2> Description</h2>

A new word game has been released which is rapidly becoming very popular.
The game consists of a deck of cards and a bag of letters. Each card
has a word written on it. The game starts with the first card of the deck
being drawn and placed face up on the table to show the word on it.
<p>
Then, the first player draws a second card to get another word. To score, this
player must write one word above the other using the letters from the bag, and
then "stretch" the words by inserting dashes between the letters in order to
make some of the letters match. Note that when a word is longer than the other,
a certain number of dashes must always be used. The score is computed as the
number of positions in which the letters in each word match minus the number of
positions in which the letters do not match minus the number of dashes used to
stretch the words. The maximum score may be negative.
</p><p>
The second player proceeds by drawing another card, writing both the new word
and the word drawn by the previous player, and stretching them to maximise the
score, and so forth, until the the last card on the deck is drawn.
The player with the maximum accumulated score wins the game.

 </p><hr> <h2>Input</h2> 

Each test case gives the information about two words, and
consists of two lines.  The first line gives the length of the first
word (<i>n</i>) and the <i>n</i>-character-long word itself. The
second line provides the same information for the second word.
The words contain neither spaces nor dashes ("-"), and may have different lengths.<p>
</p><hr>

<h2>Output</h2>

The output for each test case consists of three lines: the two stretched words
in the first two lines (including the dashes) and the corresponding score value
in the third line.<p>

Note that there may be different ways of stretching the same pair of words
to obtain the same score. Mooshak will compute the score based on the
stretched words returned by your program. The output will only be accepted
if the stretched words are valid given the input and the corresponding
score is optimal and equal to the score in the third line of the output.
