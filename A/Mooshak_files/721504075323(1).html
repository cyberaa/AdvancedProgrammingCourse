</p><h2> Description</h2>

According to a local rule, at least 75% of each road segment in a town
must be illuminated by road light. As you are now working for the
City, you want to know which roads in your town not follow that
rule. <p>

Fortunately, you have a lot of information.  For each road segment you
know the exact location of each lamppost as well as the stretch of
road it illuminates. Based on this information you want to compute how
much of the road segment is illuminated.
</p><p>

</p><hr>

<h2> Input</h2>

Each input describes a single road segment.  The first line of the
input contains the number of lampposts (<i>n</i>).  Then, each of the
following <i>n</i> lines gives the beginning and the end of the road
segment that is lit by each lamppost. Each position is a number with 6
decimal digits. Note that parts of the road may be lit by more than
one lamppost. 
<p>

</p><hr>

<h2> Output</h2> The program should output the length of the portion
of the road segment that is covered by light, rounded to 6 decimal
digits.
