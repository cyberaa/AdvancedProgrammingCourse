<title>Problem C - (Un)social network</title>


<h1 align="CENTER"> Problem C - (Un)social network</h1>

<hr>

<h2> Description</h2>

Nowadays, everybody knows many, many people. So much so, that the producers of a
TV game show are finding it increasingly difficult to find enough people
to take part in their show. Given a set of members of a social network,
they want to know the size of the largest group of people such that none
of its members know one another.

<h2>Input</h2> 


For each test case, the number of members, <i>n</i>, and the
number of connections between members, <i>m</i>, are given in the
first line, separated by white space. Then, in each of the next <i>m</i> lines,
a pair of values, also separated by white space, indicates that two members
of the network know each other. Members are numbered from <i>0</i> to
<i>n-1</i>. Note that some members may not know anyone in the network.<p>

<h2>Output</h2>

The output for each test case consists of a single line with the 
maximum size of a group of members who do not know one another.
