<title>Problem N - A swimming pool in the woods</title>


<h1 align="CENTER">Problem N - A swimming pool in the woods</h1>

<hr>


<h2>Description</h2>

A millionaire buys some woodland, and decides to build a swimming pool on it.
Unfortunately, the trees are a protected species, and must not be cut down.
Help the millionaire find the right place to build the swimming pool so
that its area is as large as possible.
<p>
The plot of land is rectangular in shape, and so should be the swimming pool. In
addition, the sides of the pool should be parallel to the sides of the plot of
land. There are no trees on the borders of the land.

<h2>Input</h2> 

The input may consist of several test cases. The first line of each test case
gives the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> (integer) coordinates of the lower-left and
upper-right corners of the plot of land, which may range from 0 to 30000,
separated by white space. Then, the number of trees on the land, <i>n&#8804;1000</i>, is
given in the second line. The following <i>n</i> lines provide the <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> coordinates of the trees, one tree per line. Different trees always
differ in both coordinates. A new test case may follow in the next line.
<hr>

<h2>Output</h2>

The output of each test case is the area of the largest axis-aligned, rectangular
swimming pool that can be built in the woodland without cutting down trees.
